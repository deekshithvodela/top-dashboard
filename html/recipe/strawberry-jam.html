                <ul>
                    <li>4 cups of fresh strawberries, hulled and chopped</li>
                    <li>4 cups of granulated sugar</li>     
                    <li>1/4 cup of lemon juice</li>
                </ul>

                <ol>    
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the chopped strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Mix well and let it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the strawberries to release their juices.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the mixture to a large saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir frequently to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the mixture thickens. You can test the consistency by placing a small amount of jam on a chilled plate and running your   finger through it. If it wrinkles and holds its shape, it's ready.</li>
                    <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour the jam into sterilized jars and seal them tightly. Let the jars cool to room temperature before storing them in the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy your homemade strawberry jam on toast, biscuits, or as a topping for desserts!</li>
